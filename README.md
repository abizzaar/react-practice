# react-practice

This is a little repo to practice React concepts. I felt motivated to do this because, as a product engineer, I am often more motivated by _what_ is being built rather than _how_ it's built. And I'm interested to understand the medium a bit more directly now, not purely as a means, but as an end in itself.

I've often valued the _feeling_ of creativity, of figuring things out anew. It feels meditative and original. But after learning a bit about chess strategy (I'm still very beginner), apparently so much of it is memorization as you moved from intermediate to advanced. And there's no point in rediscovering old patterns. Of course, intuition is still involved, but it's strengthened through memorization.

I've experienced something similar with structuring my day too. If at the start of the week I have my meals prepared, it reduces my cognitive load of figuring food out each day. And this opens up space for me to focus on the new things each day that I need to focus on.

In a similar way, I want to start understanding patterns across programming / business that I can reuse as I move through my career. Of course I will always want to have a flexible, adaptive and open mind, but being able to use patterns when needed feels important. Hopefully this will open up space for the work where creativity is actually needed.
