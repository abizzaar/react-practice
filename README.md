# react-practice

This is a little repo to practice React concepts. I felt motivated to do this because, as a product engineer, I am often more motivated by _what_ is being built rather than _how_ it's built. And I'm interested to understand the medium a bit more directly now, not purely as a means, but as an end in itself.
